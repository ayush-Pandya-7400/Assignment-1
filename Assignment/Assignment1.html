    <h3><b><u><i> Corporate History </i></u></b></h3>
    <p>
        The precursor to Marvel Comics was founded in 1939 by pulp magazine publisher Martin Goodman. In order to
        capitalize on the growing popularity of comic books—especially those starring superheroes—Goodman created Timely
        Comics. Timely’s first comic book was Marvel Comics no. 1 (cover dated October 1939), which featured several
        superhero characters, most notably the Human Torch and the Sub-Mariner. Timely Comics introduced many superhero
        characters during comics’ “Golden Age” in the 1940s, most importantly Captain America, who first appeared in
        Captain America Comics no. 1 (March 1941). Timely characters were often portrayed as fighting against the Nazis
        and the Japanese even before the United States entered World War II. As the 1940s came to a close, superheroes
        fell out of vogue with comic book readers, and Timely canceled the last of its books in this genre in 1950. In
        1951 Goodman formed his own distribution company, and Timely Comics became Atlas Magazines. Though there was a
        brief experiment in bringing back superheroes such as Captain America in 1953, Atlas’s output was mostly in
        other genres such as humour, westerns, horror, war, and science fiction.

        In 1956 rival company DC Comics ushered in the so-called Silver Age of comics by reintroducing superhero titles
        with significant commercial success. In the early 1960s Atlas changed its name to Marvel Comics. For several
        decades Marvel and DC were the top companies in the industry. Throughout the 1980s and ’90s Marvel changed hands
        numerous times, becoming a publicly held company in 1991. Questionable management decisions and a general slump
        in sales in the comic book industry drove Marvel Comics into bankruptcy in 1996. The company emerged from
        bankruptcy in 1998 and began to diversify its output, launching imprints aimed at a variety of demographics and
        expanding its cinematic offerings under the Marvel Studios banner. In 2007 Marvel began publishing digital
        comics. In 2009 the Walt Disney Company purchased the parent company of Marvel Comics.

    <h3><b><u><i> Marvel universe </i></u></b></h3>

    <p>
        The shared storytelling palette known as the Marvel universe was unveiled in 1961, when Goodman responded to the
        growing interest in superhero books by commissioning writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby to create the
        Fantastic Four. With the release of Fantastic Four no. 1 (November 1961), readers were introduced to a
        superheroic setting that was, nevertheless, rooted in the real world. Lee and Kirby attempted to make their
        comic book characters more original by allowing them to interact with each other in a realistic fashion,
        including heroes often fighting or arguing with each other. This trend continued with a flood of other superhero
        characters introduced by Marvel Comics during the early 1960s, including Spider-Man, the Incredible Hulk, and
        the X-Men. Lee wrote the majority of Marvel’s books during that time, and Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko were the
        most important and influential artists.
